			(T - space been picked/bombed, F - not been picked)
		.int shipsRemaining - keeps track of whole # ships not yet sunk

		*methods*
		-conventional getters and setters
		-public Boolean bomb(int[] square) - change that square in 	
			squaresChosen to true
			-returns True when ship is hit, False for miss
		-public Boolean makeShip(Ship s)
			-returns True is ship is created and placed in valid location
		-public Boolean isSquareEmpty(int[] square)
